USAGE:

1) gus_hipr is a sequential version of gusfield algorithm based on the HIPR maximum flow code.
2) gusp is a parallel version base on the HIPR code and using OpenMP

The make command will produce both gus_hipr and gusp.

Run gus_hipr as in:
$ gus_hipr graph.dimacs

and gusp as in:
$ gusp 10 graph.dimacs

where 10 is the number of parallel threads.
